# SmartLamp


 I present you my new development - a smart lamp created by my own hands. Thanks to innovative technologies and quality materials, it provides comfortable and energy-efficient lighting. 

-The lamp is controlled via smartphone or tablet, which allows you to control its brightness, color and modes of operation without approaching it.

- Modes of operation The luminaire has 8 different lighting modes, from regular white light to dynamic flicker. Every user will find the right one to suit their needs. 

- Display The informative display on the body of the luminaire shows the current operating mode, date and time, making it even more convenient to use. 

-Flexibility of use The luminaire easily adapts to the main lighting, providing even and soft illumination of the room. It can also be used as an additional light source to create a cozy atmosphere.
 
-Energy saving Thanks to the automatic timer switch-off, the luminaire helps to save energy.
